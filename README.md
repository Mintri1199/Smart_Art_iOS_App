# Smart Art


A web and mobile application that has a database of fine art collections and allows users to test their knowledge through quizzes.

## Problem
There is a gap in experience and enjoyment with art. Art books are also expensive to and there aren't too many interactive experiences to expose people to art.

## Solution
Smart art provides an interactive experience that allows users to play a fun quiz game to learn more about art.

## Demo

![alt tag](https://github.com/Mintri1199/Smart_Art_iOS_App/blob/master/progress_screenshots/demo_v1.2.gif)

## Installation

```
Using CocoaPods:
```
Add the following line to your Podfile:

pod 'NVActivityIndicatorView'

pod 'SwiftLint'

This will download the SwiftLint and NVActivityIndicatorView binaries and dependencies in Pods/ during your next pod install execution and will allow you to invoke it via ${PODS_ROOT}/SwiftLint/swiftlint and ${PODS_ROOT}/NVActivityIndicatorView/nvaactivityindicatorview in your Script Build Phases.

This is the recommended way to install a specific version of SwiftLint or NVActivityIndicatorView since it supports installing a pinned version rather than simply the latest.

Note that this will add the SwiftLint and NVActivityIndicatorView binaries, its dependencies' binaries and the Swift binary library distribution to the Pods/ directory.
