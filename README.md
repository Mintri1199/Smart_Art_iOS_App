# Smart Art


A web and mobile application that has a database of fine art collections and allows users to test their knowledge through quizzes.

## Problem
There is a gap in experience and enjoyment with art. Art books are also expensive to and there aren't too many interactive experiences to expose people to art.

## Solution
Smart art provides an interactive experience that allows users to play a fun quiz game to learn more about art.
