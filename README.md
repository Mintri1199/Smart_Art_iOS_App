# Smart Art


A web and mobile application that has a database of fine art collections and allows users to test their knowledge through quizzes.

## Problem
There is a gap in experience and enjoyment with art. Art books are also expensive to and there aren't too many interactive experiences to expose people to art.

## Solution
Smart art provides an interactive experience that allows users to play a fun quiz game to learn more about art.

## User Narratives
My name is Arnold the art lover. Over the past few years, I have been increasing my appreciation for art by reading art books and visiting as many museums as a I can. The more I appreciate art, the moved I become by masterpieces.

My name is Colleen the college student. As a part of my education I have taken an art appreciation class - with an emphasis on the classics.
